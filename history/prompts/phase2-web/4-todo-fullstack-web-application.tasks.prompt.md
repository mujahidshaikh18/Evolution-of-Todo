$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary

Successfully generated a comprehensive task breakdown (tasks.md) for the Todo Full-Stack Web Application - Phase II based on the planning artifacts. The tasks.md file includes:

1. **9 Phases** organized by implementation priority:
   - Phase 1: Setup Tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational Tasks (blocking prerequisites)
   - Phase 3: User Story 1 - Authentication (P1 priority)
   - Phase 4: User Story 2 - Create Tasks (P1 priority)
   - Phase 5: User Story 3 - View Tasks (P1 priority)
   - Phase 6: User Story 4 - Update Tasks (P2 priority)
   - Phase 7: User Story 5 - Complete/Delete Tasks (P2 priority)
   - Phase 8: User Story 6 - Security/Isolation (P1 priority)
   - Phase 9: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

2. **77 Individual Tasks** following the checklist format:
   - Each task includes proper checkbox, ID, parallelization markers, user story labels
   - Tasks are mapped to specific files and components as identified in the planning documents
   - Priority levels and dependencies are clearly indicated

3. **Organizational Features**:
   - Implementation strategy with MVP scope definition
   - Independent test criteria for each user story
   - Dependencies section showing user story completion order
   - Parallel execution opportunities identified for development efficiency

4. **Alignment with Planning Artifacts**:
   - Tasks mapped to entities from data-model.md (User, Task models)
   - Tasks mapped to API endpoints from contracts/tasks-api.md
   - Tasks organized by user story priorities from spec.md
   - Technical decisions from research.md implemented in appropriate tasks

The task breakdown follows the Spec-Kit Plus methodology and is ready for implementation, with each task specific enough for an LLM to execute without additional context.
