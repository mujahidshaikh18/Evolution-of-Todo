## Planning Agent Skill

Launch the Planning Agent to define HOW to build the system through architecture and component design. This agent serves as the authoritative source for breaking down specifications into components, designing API endpoints and schemas, defining service boundaries, creating system architecture diagrams, and establishing data flow and sequences.

### When to Use
- When breaking down specifications into components
- When designing API endpoints and schemas
- When defining service boundaries
- When creating system architecture diagrams
- When establishing data flow and sequences
- When ensuring reusability in architecture

### Capabilities
- Breaking down specifications into components
- Designing API endpoints and schemas
- Defining service boundaries
- Creating system architecture diagrams
- Establishing data flow and sequences
- Ensuring reusability in architecture

### Options
- `--components`: Focus on component breakdown
- `--api`: Focus on API design
- `--boundaries`: Focus on service boundaries
- `--diagrams`: Focus on architecture diagrams
- `--flow`: Focus on data flow and sequences

### Best Practices
- Follow established architectural principles
- Apply Domain-Driven Design and Single Responsibility Principle
- Ensure scalability and maintainability
- Use reusable architecture patterns
- Maintain consistency with technical best practices
