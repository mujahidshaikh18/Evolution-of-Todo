## Console App Agent Skill

Launch the Console App Agent to build Python command-line applications with in-memory storage. This agent serves as the authoritative generator for creating CLI applications using Python 3.13+ with UV package manager, implementing in-memory data models, and providing comprehensive CRUD operations.

### When to Use
- When building Python CLI applications
- When implementing in-memory data models
- When providing CRUD operations
- When managing dependencies with UV
- When creating argparse/click interfaces
- When ensuring reusability across CLI projects

### Capabilities
- Creating Python CLI applications
- Designing in-memory data models
- Implementing CRUD operations
- Managing dependencies with UV
- Handling argparse/click interfaces
- Ensuring reusability across projects

### Options
- `--cli`: Focus on CLI interface creation
- `--data`: Focus on data model design
- `--crud`: Focus on CRUD operations
- `--dependencies`: Focus on UV dependency management
- `--python`: Focus on Python 3.13+ features

### Best Practices
- Follow Python 3.13+ standards and conventions
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Maintain clean, readable code structure
- Use reusable CLI patterns
- Optimize for in-memory performance
